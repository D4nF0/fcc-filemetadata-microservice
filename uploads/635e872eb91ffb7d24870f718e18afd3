EVERYTHING HANGS ON ONE´S THINKING. A MAN IS AS UNHAPPY, AS HE CONVICED HIMSELF, HE IS - Seneca

1. World is a beautiful place -- get to see the whole entirety of it

2. Smile -- there is 100% chance that you or somebody you love will die -- donť you worry about the litlle problems, enjoy the current moment

3. Be strong -- be able to provide, be physicaly capable and be kind - you will be more likeable

4. Being likeable is always an advantage -- be dominant, be confident in your abilities, be communicative

5. Protect others -- especialy women --- you gave yourself a promise
 
#6. The biggest pain is the pain of regret so donť be afraid of new things, suffering and risk -- be disciplined and take action --> if it fails nothing happens, you will just get up - if it works out, your whole life will change - and maybe, it will turn out better than you can imagine 

7. Act everyday the way, you can be proud of yourself in the end - work hard, resist temptations and don't break your code

8. Stand behind your ideals -- don't be afraid of arguing and fighting for what you believe in  

9. Live in a moment --
if you are depressed, you are living in the past.
if you are anxious, you are living in the future.
if you are at peace, you are living in the moment.
- Lao Tzu
